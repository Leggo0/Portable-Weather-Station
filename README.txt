This is the README.txt for the Weather Station
Created by Austin Salois, Sonoma State SCI220, Fall 2018

This project was created in collaboration Chris Halle for the Science 220
partner project. The purpose of this project was to create a portable
easy to use Weather Station to collect local data on Fairfield Osborn Preserve.
While there is a weather station on said preserve, it is useful to have
data specified for the exact area you are working in. The end product
was designed to be modular, easily adaptable for more sensors, easy to use and
low cost so multiple could be made for use during research on the preserve.
Some guides used for this build are linked below for future use in
troubleshooting any issues with the portable weather station.
